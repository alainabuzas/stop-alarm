<p>If you have a long commute via public transit, you've probably dozed off once or twice and missed your stop. One Snooze Away is here to make sure you never sleep through your stop again. Simply search for your destination, set an alarm, and take a nap. We'll wake you up when the bus is approaching your stop.</p>

<p>One Snooze Away is currently in Beta! We're looking forward to adding more features in the future, like custom alarm sounds.</p>

<p>One Snooze Away uses the Google Maps API and the King Country Transit API. Thanks!</p>
